The phial is made of a transparent, hollow crystal. Within it swirls a darkness
as black and roiling like a thundercloud. The thin layer of crystal encasing
the darkness looks brittle, with many thin cracks creating strange patterns
across its surface. The cracks appear to spread even as you watch the
mysterious object, splintering across its surface.

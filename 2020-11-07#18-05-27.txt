At first glance this tall, handsome Ent could be mistaken for a resplendent 
beech tree. However, his downcast posture and the solemn sadness in his deep
penetrating eyes shows there is a soul within this seemingly woody exterior.
His skin is a shining silver in colour and is as smooth as leather. Atop his 
stately head is mounted a flourish of glossy, ovate leaves. Fine hair-like 
lichens cover his long, elegant arms. Each arm eventually splits into four 
slender, twig-like fingers. His straight sturdy legs are flanged at the base 
and he wears a covering of moss, like shoes, on his feet.

You look upon a solemn Noldo Elf from another age. Burdened with the weight
of Eregion's spirits, Amanrandil tirelessly leads the Daedeltiri to ease their
suffering. The Daedeltiri have sworn to watch the shadows of the ancient 
elven dead and to protect them and others from the horrors of the past. Once
regal and proud like the rest of his  people, he now walks with a saintly aura
of humility and sorrow. But deep within the eyes of this peaceful elf you 
sense the tension of an undying rage forever held against the evil of all 
Sauron's works.

examine Amanrandil
You look upon a solemn Noldo Elf from another age. Burdened with the weight
of Eregion's spirits, Amanrandil tirelessly leads the Daedeltiri to ease their
suffering. The Daedeltiri have sworn to watch the shadows of the ancient 
elven dead and to protect them and others from the horrors of the past. Once
regal and proud like the rest of his  people, he now walks with a saintly aura
of humility and sorrow. But deep within the eyes of this peaceful elf you 
sense the tension of an undying rage forever held against the evil of all 
Sauron's works.
Amanrandil is in an excellent condition.

ABOUT, MUME


What is MUME?
-------------
MUME, Multi-Users in Middle-earth, is a multiplayer role-playing game based
upon J.R.R. Tolkien's creations.

The action takes place in the late Third Age, before The Hobbit and after the
loss of the One Ring by Sauron. The key to Erebor has just found by Gandalf in
Dol Guldur and all the epic tales narrated in The Lord of the Rings may take
place.

MUME is written in C and in mudlle (a functional language that was developed in
order to allow online extensions to the game) and has been running since
January 1992.

MUME is running on a FIRE machine. You can either play by connecting directly
by telnet to mume.org port 4242 or connecting via the web client on our
website.

If you are new to MUME or MUDs in general, you should consult our newbie page,
help newcomer. It contains introductory texts for complete beginners, as well
as information on MUME's unique features for those who have already played
other MUDs.

To see how MUME (d)evolved over the years, try help mume <version>, where
<version> is a Roman numeral (I, II, III, IV, etc.).

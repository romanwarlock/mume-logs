DIP, FOCI, FOCUS

A focus is an object imbued with powerful magic and bound to its owner. Several kinds of foci are rumoured to
exist, each endowed with different powers. A warrior might prefer a focus which enhances his battle prowess or
weakens his enemies, a sorcerer could instead focus on his arcane arts or on healing.

Certain focus powers are constantly active; others must be explicitly called upon, through "use <item>
<target>". The target can be oneself, someone else, or on an entire group.

Foci are created by casting "create focus" on the appropriate material component. If the ceremony is performed
in the right place and in the right way, the vessel must also be enchanted and blessed. When all is done
correctly the foci is bound to the caster.

People cannot own more than one focus at any given time: old foci will lose their powers whenever a new focus is
created.

Creating some of the foci requires to "dip" a component into one of the pools on Tol Eressea or in Valinor.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.

forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your

Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.

Looking upon his blood-covered form, the sweet coppery smell of blood
pervades the air. His armour has many splotches of fresh blood on it, and
his shield, mounting a savage spike is bathed in the red essence of those
who came before you. On his face, several smears of dark red can be seen,
highlighting his eyes and viciously cruel mouth. He stands tall for an
orc, and is undeniably an Uruk-moragog.

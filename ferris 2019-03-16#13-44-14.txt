She has not grown very high, but this orc has broad shoulders and
seems very
strong. The long, dark hair falls down to her hips; many scalps and
small   
bones have been plaited into it. Her armour bears the scars of many
fights, 
and many healed wounds can be seen where the leather does not cover
her skin.
In her face, she bears two parallel scars, one on each cheek, and a
long
cleft across her face indicates her commanding rank among her tribe.
Her eyes
are cold, demanding, like two frozen lakes without bottom, indicating
she
gets, just takes, what she wants and destroys what comes into her path
.
Lazrria the Orkish Commander has some big nasty scratches.

of the plants are holly derivatives, but you can see where ferns and

foliage has made an appearance. Winding through the valley are two

Sapho is a level seventeen Half-Elven Priestess.
Raised as a scholar by the wisest among the Noldo, Sapho soon
came to see the true beauty of all the creations of the Ainu
even those that had been tainted by Melkors endless envy.

After many years of study she came to the city of Lothlorien
and was priviledged to explore the wisdom of lady Galadriel
which finally led to her becoming a priestess and guardian
of the forest.

BUG, IDEA, REPORT, TYPO

For making useful suggestions to the maintainers of the game. You
will use the standard line editor (enter a %e on a single line to
end).

Examples:

> bug I can't move east from here
> idea Fish should be cookable
> typo Hill giant description
> report Lost my account password - help!

Please note that bug, idea, and typo messages are visible to all the
Ainur. It is recommended you use report, which is visible only to
the Valar, in case confidentiality is required (e.g. reports about
suspected cheating, reports about significant bugs that could be
easily abused, requests about lost passwords...) or when you could
not reach a V+ via pray.
See news 2361 for the original announcement.

These commands are valuable to the gods, and a few basic guidelines
should be observed when using them:

 * Make your comments CONCISE and CLEAR. There are often pages of

*** Return: continue, b: back, r: redisplay, q: quit (32%) *** 

   messages containing these reports, and to read more than a few
   paragraphs is simply out of the question. Simply state your
   point, but be thorough. If you can, include a short log, for
   example:
   > say open the gate
   The gatekeeper says 'does it seem I work here?'

 * There is no need to state wherabouts in arda the room is you are
   posting from. That is recorded and displayed in your post
   automatically.

 * Use a subject. Type in the subject, in a few words, after the
   command. It makes it easier to read.
   E.g. 'bug orkish chieftain isn't aggressive to whities'

 * Use the correct command! Any 'bug' which only involves the wrong
   form of text being output is a typo. And if it is confidential,
   it is a 'report'. Please remember this :)

 * MUME is based on Tolkien's (British) English. Some words, like
   recognised, may seem strange to American English speakers, but
   are not typos. Check http://www.m-w.com if you are in doubt.

 * Do not repeat your report. If the bug or typo is still remaining
   after a few days, there's no need to rewrite it. It will be

*** Return: continue, b: back, r: redisplay, q: quit (72%) *** 

   fixed.

Example for reporting:
1. Type the command followed by the title of your report, e.g.

  > bug Shopkeeper's prices are too high

2. Now the lineeditor opens and you can explain the problem in
detail, for example:

   : The prices in this shop seem to be multiplied with 1000, the red
ruby 
   : costs 65.000 goldpieces. 
   : %e

3. To send your report type '%e' on an empty line, to cancel the
report '%q'.

Remember to put a linebreak (hit enter) at the end of each line
(after 79 characters), the editor does not do that automatically.

Also, if it is an idea, you must check HELP NOIDEA first to see
whether you are wasting your time. Any idea which is ruled no-idea
will be deleted on sight, so save your time.

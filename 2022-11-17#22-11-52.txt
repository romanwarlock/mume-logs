CHANGE TITLE, TITLES

Starting on level 21, characters on MUME can choose their own title using change title <new title>.

You can clear the title by typing change title none.

See also: RULE TITLES

!# W>rules title
TITLES

Heroes and legends on MUME can choose their own title. While they have great freedom in choosing it, a basic
rule must be obeyed: a title must not provide false information.

Examples of forbidden titles:
 * Wiz the Elven Apprentice of Magic (a legend is not a level 1)
 * Panoramix the White (title reserved to the Tan Istar)
 * Joe the Orc. (when joe is actually a human)

Also be aware, that all titles should refer to the player in question. Hence the title "Slash is a jerk" is
not acceptable. Also the title should be something that other players would find acceptable.

All titles must be in English or any of the languages used in Middle-earth!

All titles are subject to veto by the higher gods, namely Shaper or above.

!# W>pray fyi uno has illegal title. read rules title
You send your prayer to the Ainur.

!# W>help mail
FORWARD, MAIL, MAILBOX

The mail system lets you send a message to one or more recipients. Mail has a lifetime of 60 days if unread
and 30 if read. Because mail is persistent, it is used most often to communicate with someone who is not
always easy to reach.

To send or read mail you have to go to a mail box. This is a special board where messages are addressed to
one or many recipients.

To send mail, use:
  > write <title> @<recipient> @<recipient> ...

The title is optional, but at least one recipient is needed.

Example:
  > write Happy birthday @bilbo @frodo

How it goes on depends on your editor. If you use the line editor, please read help editor.

Other commands

  look mail                       lists mail addressed to you
  tail                            lists the 20 last mails to you
  tail <number>                   lists the <number> last mails to you
  read <number>                   reads a specific mail
  look sent mail                  lists mail you have sent
  read sent <number>              reads a mail you have sent
  reply <number>                  reply to a mail
  forward <number> @gandalf       forward a mail to Gandalf
  forward sent <number> @gandalf  forward a previously sent mail to Gandalf
  search mail <some text>         search for <some text> in your mailbox

*** Return: continue, b: back, r: redisplay, q: quit (52%) *** 

  search sent mail <some text>    search in sent mails

Messages you have already read are marked with +. A + next to a sent mail indicates it has been read by at
least one person on the recipient list.

To see exactly who has read a mail, use look seen mail or look sent seen mail.

You can remove messages with remove <number>, or remove sent <number>, and reply to a message with reply
<number> <optional title>.

Note that the mail you create will become a single message which is accessible to the people you provide. As
it only exists as one message, should any of the recipients delete it from their mail box, it will be deleted
from all of the other, too -- unless you use a selective remove.

You can add someone to CC of an existing mail: forward sent <number> --retroactive-cc @gandalf.

To selectively remove mails: remove --from-my-inbox-only <number>. You can also disavow a mail by remove sent
--from-my-outbox <number>; however, removing a mail from your outbox causes the mail to appear as though the
sender was deleted: (*Lost*).

For Ainur, special recipients are @valar or @aratar, which sends your mail to all V+ or all A+. Mortals
should usually report instead.

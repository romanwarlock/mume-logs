This troll has been bred by the Burzruth orcs to serve as a source of food.
Its flesh is soft and bloated, it is not as fast or strong as its captive
forbears, and it is virtually mindless.  However, it is blindly hungry and
unusually large.  It has been conditioned to eat bats, prisoners, others
of its kind, and, indeed, anything other than its Burzruth guards.  It gapes
at you, drools, waddles toward you, and swings its meaty fist in your 
direction.
A huge troll (aa) has several bruises.

Standing taller than any around him, this olog has a distinct aura of power
about him. As the High Lieutenant of Durin's Bane he commands the Balrog's
forces in Moria and is a fearsome creature indeed. His red, fiery eyes look
out from the deep sockets and his skin shines a scaly jet black.
Muranog is in very bad shape.

Ok.
Your spray of light rips Muranog apart completely, killing him.
You receive your share of experience.
Good job!
You hear Muranog's death cry as he collapses.
Muranog is dead! R.I.P.
A shadow slowly rises above the corpse of Muranog.
